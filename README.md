Overview

This project simulates the movement of a single ball in a defined space. It demonstrates basic principles of motion and can be used as a foundation for more complex simulations.

Features

Basic Movement: The ball moves in a straight line.

Boundary Collision: The ball bounces off the edges of the defined area.

Customizable Speed and Direction: Users can adjust the speed and direction of the ball.
